## Chrome-Newtab

This is a simple new tab page for chrome. I needed a way to quickly note down stuff for copy paste. I also had a list of frequently visited websites. So I wrote a simple new tab page that serves my purpose.

It uses [Trix Editor](https://github.com/basecamp/trix) for a WYSIWYG editor. It also has an options page where you can specify a list of websites to be shown on the new tab page.

The content of the editor is saved to `localStorage` every time a change occurs.

_You are free to use this in any way you like._
